# Production API Configuration
# TODO: Update this URL to your deployed Spring Boot backend URL when ready
# For now, this points to localhost - the hosted app won't be able to connect to your backend
# until you deploy the Spring Boot application to a cloud service (like Railway, Heroku, etc.)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api

# Alternative: Use a deployed backend URL (uncomment and update when ready)
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-deployed-backend.railway.app/api

# Disable mock API in production
VITE_USE_MOCK_API=false
